                During the surge of Covid-19, individuals and communities were
                faced with the most difficult challenges. The economy was

                to the lives of many. <b>Grabbit+</b> not only offered vending services
                during this time but also assisted institutions across the

                range of health and hygiene solutions expediently available.
